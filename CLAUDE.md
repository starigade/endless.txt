# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Generate Xcode project (required before first build)
cd endless.txt && xcodegen generate

# Open in Xcode
open endless.txt/NvrEndingTxt.xcodeproj

# Build from command line
xcodebuild -project endless.txt/NvrEndingTxt.xcodeproj -scheme NvrEndingTxt -configuration Debug build
```

**Prerequisites:** `brew install xcodegen`

## Architecture

This is a macOS menu bar app (no dock icon) for quick thought capture to a single text file.

### Key Components

- **AppDelegate** (`AppDelegate.swift`) - Central coordinator managing menu bar status item, floating panel lifecycle, and global hotkey registration. Implements `NSWindowDelegate` for window frame persistence.

- **FloatingPanel** (`Views/FloatingPanel.swift`) - Custom `NSPanel` subclass that enables keyboard input on a borderless window. Required because standard `NSWindow` doesn't receive key events when borderless.

- **HotkeyManager** (`Services/HotkeyManager.swift`) - Carbon API wrapper for system-wide keyboard shortcuts. Uses `RegisterEventHotKey` because there's no native Swift API for global hotkeys.

- **FileService** (`Services/FileService.swift`) - Singleton handling text file I/O with 500ms debounced auto-save. Uses Combine's `@Published` for reactive UI updates.

- **AppSettings** (`Models/AppSettings.swift`) - Singleton using `@AppStorage` for UserDefaults-backed preferences. Contains theme definitions (`AppTheme` enum) and shortcut key configuration.

### Communication Patterns

Cross-component communication uses `NotificationCenter`:
- `.focusQuickEntry` - Focus the quick entry text field when panel opens
- `.hotkeyChanged` - Re-register global hotkey when user changes shortcut

### Window Behavior

The app uses `NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` combined with `LSUIElement = true` in Info.plist to hide from dock. The panel uses `.nonactivatingPanel` collection behavior to appear over other apps without stealing focus aggressively.
